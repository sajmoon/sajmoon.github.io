Im a web developer so this should be interesting.</p>\n<p>Will try to document what and how I learn both Swift as a language and the SDKs and inner workings of iOS.</p>\n<h2>Where to start</h2>\n<h3>Read the docs</h3>\n<p>Apples <em>The Swift Programming Langugae</em> is a great book. It talks about all the language features without the SDK for iOS. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309">Read it</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a table view - <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/CreateATableView.html">Apple documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stanford course</h3>\n<p>Standford has a open course for app development with swift <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316">here</a>. Only avaialbe for apple devices.</p>\n<p>I found some episodes on youtube:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUFW6NxlSE">Episode 1</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiROf0aHI4k">Episode 2</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZldHF69C_s">Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHv6QVHId6Q">Episode 4</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n7cqFdJd1U">Episode 5</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other resiources</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.appcoda.com/learnswift/">https://www.appcoda.com/learnswift/</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/160521/storyboards-tutorial-ios-11-part-1">https://www.raywenderlich.com/160521/storyboards-tutorial-ios-11-part-1</a></li>\n<li>Build a logger (simple use of extensions and more) <a href="https://medium.com/@sauvik_dolui/developing-a-tiny-logger-in-swift-7221751628e6">https://medium.com/@sauvik_dolui/developing-a-tiny-logger-in-swift-7221751628e6</a></li>\n<li>Declare new infix operators <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AdvancedOperators.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift<em>Programming</em>Language/AdvancedOperators.html</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Write code</h2>\n<h3>Playground</h3>\n<p>It’s important to write code to learn. So start building something. However, sometimes it can help to try out new language features. Xcode has a playground feature. Start a new empty playground and you can follow along in <em>The Swift Programming Lanugauge</em> book and try it out.</p>\n<p>You can do pretty advanced stuff in the playground, showing the code and the final product at the same time. Perfect for learning things.</p>\n<p>Read more about the playground and find examples <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Excersism</h3>\n<p>Excersism is a great way to learn new things. You have a very small and well defined problem to solve. They provide test cases and your job is to make them pass.</p>\n<p>Then you can get feedback on your solution from the community or read someone elses code. Then iterate and improve your solution. It’s quite awesome.
