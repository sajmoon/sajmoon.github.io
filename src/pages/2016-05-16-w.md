title: Working Ecto embeds in Phoenix

I was playing around with a small phoenix app and wanted to embed some data in the model instead of of having an additional table.

I want one model called `Profile`. A profile should have some fields, and embed `address`.

```language-bash
mix phoenix.new {AppName}
cd {AppName}
mix test
```

That is your basic app. Now we need our profile, so let us generate it.

``` language-bash
mix phoenix.gen.controller Profile profiles name:string email:string
```

This will give us a controller and a model, and some basic tests for it.

No we need to add our embedded model `address`. It will be stored in a jsonb column on the profile model.

In the end we want to be able to see the address from the show action on the ProfileController. So we modify the ProfileController#show to reflect the end result we want.

```language-elixir
test "shows chosen resource", %{conn: conn} do
    profile = Repo.insert! %Profile{}
    changeset = Ecto.Changeset.change(profile)

    changeset = Ecto.Changeset.put_embed(changeset, :address,
      %Resume.Address{
        street: "StreetName",
        city: "TheCityOfMyDreams",
        zip: "12345",
        country: "MyCountry"
      }
    )
    Repo.update!(changeset)

    conn = get conn, profile_path(conn, :show, profile)
    assert json_response(conn, 200)["data"] == %{"id" => profile.id,
      "name" => profile.name,
      "email" => profile.email,
      "address" => %{
        "city" => "TheCityOfMyDreams",
        "country" => "MyCountry",
        "street" => "StreetName",
        "zip" => "12345",
      }
    }
  end
```

To set an address to our profile we use  Ecto.Changeset.put_embed/3. 

The controller action does the correct thing; it fetches the profile and renders it. However, the rendering function does not by default include the address. To add it modify the profile view file.

```language-elixir
  def render("profile.json", %{profile: profile}) do
    %{
      id: profile.id,
      name: profile.name,
      email: profile.email,
      address: render_one(profile.address, MyApp.AddressView, "address.json")
    }
  end
```

We call MyAppAddressView and asks it to render an address. So we need to implement it. Create `web/view/address_view.ex` with the following.

```language-elixir
defmodule MyApp.AddressView do
  use Resume.Web, :view

  def render("address.json", %{address: address}) do
    %{
      street: address.street,
      zip: address.zip,
      city: address.city,
      country: address.country
    }
  end
end
```

Cool!

Easy and explicit. Here we assume that profile.address is a valid thing. It should be embedded in the model.

The tests for it would be something like this:
```language-elixir
 test "has embedded address" do
    changeset = Profile.changeset(%Profile{}, @valid_attrs)
    changeset = Ecto.Changeset.put_embed(changeset, :address,
      %Resume.Address{ street: "StreetName" }
    )

    assert changeset.changes.address.changes.street == "StreetName"
  end
```

It is a bit to explicit to check that the street name is correct, but it does the trick. Refactoring is your friend.

Now let us add address to profiles, and make this test pass.
```language-elixir
  schema "profiles" do
    field :name, :string
    field :email, :string
    embeds_one :address, MyApp.Address

    timestamps
  end
```

We state that we want profiles to have ONE address, and we define an address to be MyApp.Address. Create a new model for it in `web/model/address.ex`

```language-elixir
defmodule Resume.Address do
  use Ecto.Schema

  embedded_schema do
    field :street, :string
    field :zip, :string
    field :city, :string
    field :country, :string

    timestamps
  end
end
```

Nothing fancy. It just defines a schema. But for this to work, profiles needs a place to store it. We will add a `address` column in the `profile` table. It should be of type `jsonb`. We do that by setting it to a map.

Create a new migration
```language-elixir
mix ecto.gen.migration AddAddressToProfile
```

Open the new file and add the migration

```language-elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.AddAddressToProfile do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def change do
    alter table(:profiles) do
      add :address, :map
    end
  end
end
```

We use the type `map`.

```language-bash
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate
mix test
```

It should all be green and pretty.
