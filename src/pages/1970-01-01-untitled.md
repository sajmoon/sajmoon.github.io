Setting up a small (minimal cluster) with several services running on.

## Basics

- Create cluster

```
gcloud container clusters clustername
```

> Make sure you store all configurations in deployment.yaml files so you can easily modify your setup later. 

- Create a persistent disc space.

```
gcloud compute disks create --size 10GB my-disk
```

Add volume configuration to your deployment.yaml file.
```
      ports:
         ...
      volumeMounts:
          # This name must match the volumes.name below.
        - name: my-persistent-storage
          mountPath: /var/lib/application
volumes:
    - name: my-persistent-storage
      gcePersistentDisk:
        # This disk must already exist.
        pdName: my-disk
        fsType: ext4
```
