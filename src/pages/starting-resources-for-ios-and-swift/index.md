I got a new job and here our main platform is iOS. Im a web developer so this should be interesting.

Will try to document what and how I learn both Swift as a language and the SDKs and inner workings of iOS.

## Where to start

### Read the docs

Apples _The Swift Programming Langugae_ is a great book. It talks about all the language features without the SDK for iOS. [Read it](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309)

- Build a table view - [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/CreateATableView.html)

### Stanford course

Standford has a open course for app development with swift [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-11-apps-with-swift/id1309275316). Only avaialbe for apple devices.

I found some episodes on youtube:

* [Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnUFW6NxlSE)
* [Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiROf0aHI4k)
* [Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZldHF69C_s)
* [Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHv6QVHId6Q)
* [Episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n7cqFdJd1U)

## Write code

### Playground

It's important to write code to learn. So start building something. However, sometimes it can help to try out new language features. Xcode has a playground feature. Start a new empty playground and you can follow along in _The Swift Programming Lanugauge_ book and try it out.

You can do pretty advanced stuff in the playground, showing the code and the final product at the same time. Perfect for learning things.

Read more about the playground and find examples [here](https://developer.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/).

### Excersism

Excersism is a great way to learn new things. You have a very small and well defined problem to solve. They provide test cases and your job is to make them pass.

Then you can get feedback on your solution from the community or read someone elses code. Then iterate and improve your solution. It's quite awesome. Have a look [http://exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/swift/about)
